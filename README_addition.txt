### Leaderboards & persistent high scores

This repo includes an SQLite-based high score system (`highscores.py`). After finishing a game you can choose to save your score; leaderboards are stored in `highscores.db` in the repository root (it's recommended to add `highscores.db` to `.gitignore`).

Use `python show_leaderboard.py` to view top scores across games or for a specific game.
