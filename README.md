# 🎮 arcadeKh4n — Updated README

Small games built by Farooq Khan (aka **dataKh4n**) — for fun, logic, and chaos.

## 🧩 About

arcadeKh4n is a personal mini-arcade — a collection of small, beginner-friendly Python games created to explore logic, randomness, and coding creativity.

Each game is intentionally simple and easy to run locally so learners can read, modify, and experiment with the code.
